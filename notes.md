##### Moral ethics in theology and Pascals Provincial Letters
In the 17th century theology was dealing with a debate on moral ethics. The main point of the debate was to identify ways of behaving when in doubt and especially when the subjective alternative is in conflict with the law or codex. The issue is highly relevant for defining what is probable and what not. The following schools of thought existed:

- **Tutiorism**: Always choose the safer (lat. *tutior*) option in order to avoid harm (*precautionary principle*). At that time the "safer" option was always the law.
- **Probabiliorism**: Choose the option that seems more plausible (lat. prababilior).
- **Aequiprobabilism**: If two equally plausible options exists, one has the freedom of choice.
- **Probabilism**: As long as one probable and plausible alternative exists, one has the freedom to follow it, even though another more probable one might exist.
- **Laxism**: Follow whatever probable alternative exists. A questionable law does not bind one to follow it (*lex dubia non obligat*).

In the *Provincial Letters* Pascal mocks laxists views and the use of probabilism to justify any action. The letters are a literary master piece with the use of humor in dialogues being way ahead of Pascals time.

##### Distorting ancient legal methods of proof to match ones need (Criticism of the witchcraft trials)
The German Jesuit priest, poet and canon lawyer Friedrich von Spee was one of many critics of the legal twists in logic applied in the witchcraft trials of the 17th century. In his notable work *Cautio Criminalis* he states that ancient proofs in law have been misused, so the accused has no chance of clearing her name:

> [...] either Gaia has led a bad and improper life, or she has led a good and proper one. If a bad one, then, they say,
the proof is cogent against her; for from malice to malice the presumption is strong,. If, however, she has led a good one,
this also is none the less a proof; for thus, they say, are witches wont to cloak themselves and try to seem especially proper.

He further notices that if such reasoning continues to be applied, sooner or later all people will be found guilty as
escape from the deterministic proofs is not possible.

##### Nietsche aphorisms

"Formel meines Glücks: ein Ja, ein Nein, eine gerade Linie, ein Ziel ..."

"Du läufst voran? - Tust du das als Hirt; oder als Ausnahme? Ein dritter Fall wäre der Entlaufene ... *Erste Gewissensfrage*."

"Bist du echt? oder nur ein Schauspieler? Ein Vertreter? oder das Vertretene selbst? - Zuletzt bist du gar bloß ein nachgemachter Schauspieler ... *Zweite Gewissensfrage*."

"Bist du einer, der zusieht? oder der Hand anlegt? - oder der wegsieht, beiseite geht ... *Dritte Gewissensfrage*."

"Willst du mitgehn? oder vorangehn? oder für dich gehn?..Man muss wissen, was man will und dass man will. ... *Vierte Gewissensfrage*."

"Posthume Menschen - ich zum Beispiel - werden schlechter verstanden als zeitgemäße, aber besser *gehört*. Strenger: wir werden nie verstanden - und *daher* unsre Autorität."

"Ich misstraue allen Systematikern und gehe ihnen aus dem Weg. Der Wille zum System ist ein Mangel an Rechtschaffenheit."

##### Glossators half-proof and Postglossators degrees of evidence
Around 1050 in Pavia some commentators on Lombard law started studying text of law in order to find passages that are at odds with each other and thus need reconciliation. These *Glossators* also defined the term ***half-proof (semiplena probatio)*** starting around 1190 (most notably Azo of Bologna):
- If full proof is by two witnesses than half proof is by one.
- The same applies to documents as evidence which were half-proof but could be added with a witness proof to form full proofs
The following questions arise:
- Is additivity of half-proofs a reasonable thing to do? Either there is proof or there is not.
- If there is half-proof, can there be different grades of proof?

The Postglossators agreed that there must be a fine grading of evidence. As Baldus mentions:
- Suspicion is a hunch or state of mind towards something.
- Presumptions are concepts caused by probable conjecture.
- Conjecture: Acceptance of something being true on the basis of another thing.
- Suspicions, presumptions, conjectures and facts joined together in proof of some conclusion are valid arguments.

Thus, Baldus realized that at full-proof can be arrived at through argumentation (i.e. application of what we nowadays call logic). It is important to note that the Glossators and Postglossators arrived at this without the formal use of mathematics or probability theory (see Franklins book: Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability before Pascal).

##### Proof beyond reasonable doubt in ancient law
In ancient law a high standard of proof was required to convict any accused. In the *Talmud* and the *Roman Corpus of Civil Law* (which developed independently, but share huge similarities) proof needed to be beyond reasonable doubt. Example from the Talmud:

> Witnesses in capital charges were brought in and warned: perhaps what you say is based only on conjecture, or hearasy, or is evidence form the mouth of another witness [...] but in capital cases one is held responsible for his blood and the blood of his descendants till the end of the world.

On conjecture:

> Perhaps you saw him running after his fellow into a ruin, you pursuid him, and found him sword in hand with blood dripping from it, whilst the murdered man was writhing. If this is what you saw, you saw nothing.
