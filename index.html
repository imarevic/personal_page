<h4><strong>About me</strong></h4>
<br>
<p>
My name is Ivan Marevic, I am working as a Data Scientist. I enjoy software engineering, probability theory, reading books (especially on philosophy and the classics) and playing tennis.
<br><br>
When not working, I kill time doing fullstack web-development using the <em>MERN stack</em> (sometimes I exchange <em>N[node.js]</em> for <em>P[Python]</em> or vary databases, but in general I am a fan of <em>node</em> and <em>React</em>).
As a Data Scientist I also enjoy learning about probability theory in order to understand the inner workings of the many statistical learning algorithms. <br>
A nice side effect of developing learning algorithms on big data, is the data engineering side of things, while being able to use big data frameworks (<em>Hadoop, Spark, Hive, etc.</em>).

This site is mainly an attempt at collecting projects and thoughts on topics that interest me. If you have comments on these topics or the content, feel free to contact me.
