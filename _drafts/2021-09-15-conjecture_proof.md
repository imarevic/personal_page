title: Evidence and Probability before the Existence of Probability Theory

I recently read the book *The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability before Pascal* by James Franklin, in which means of making probability judgments and evidence assessments are outlined before the emergence of formal probability theory in the 16th (Cardano) and 17th century (Fermat and Pascal).

Given that we nowadays rely heavily on probability theory in science and industry, it was interesting to see what the origins of probability theory are and how people made judgments in the absence of the tools that we have today. The book mentions that early developments of proofs to make judgments have their origins in ancient and medieval law, with some of the legal principles still in use today. The book further describes conjectures that do not rely on quantified probabilities and measure theory in areas such as logic, science, philosophy, religion, aleatory contracts, and games of chance up to the 17th century. In the following I will outline some major points of the book in these areas:

##### Notion of probability in ancient law



##### Rhetoric and logic



##### Science



##### Philosophy



##### Religion



##### Aleatory contracts



##### Games of chance



##### Survival of unquantified probability
