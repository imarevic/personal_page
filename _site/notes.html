<h5 id="glossators-half-proof-and-postglossators-degrees-of-evidence">Glossators half-proof and Postglossators degrees of evidence</h5>
<p>Around 1050 in Pavia some commentators on Lombard law started studying text of law in order to find passages that are at odds with each other and thus need reconciliation. These <em>Glossators</em> also defined the term <strong><em>half-proof (semiplena probatio)</em></strong> starting around 1190 (most notably Azo of Bologna):</p>
<ul>
  <li>If full proof is by two witnesses than half proof is by one.</li>
  <li>The same applies to documents as evidence which were half-proof but could be added with a witness proof to form full proofs
The following questions arise:</li>
  <li>Is additivity of half-proofs a reasonable thing to do? Either there is proof or there is not.</li>
  <li>If there is half-proof, can there be different grades of proof?</li>
</ul>

<p>The Postglossators agreed that there must be a fine grading of evidence. As Baldus mentions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Suspicion is a hunch or state of mind towards something.</li>
  <li>Presumptions are concepts caused by probable conjecture.</li>
  <li>Conjecture: Acceptance of something being true on the basis of another thing.</li>
  <li>Suspicions, presumptions, conjectures and facts joined together in proof of some conclusion are valid arguments.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus Baldus realized that at full-proof can be arrived at through argumentation (i.e. application of what we nowadays call logic). It is important to note that the Glossators and Postglossators arrived at this without the formal use of mathematics or probability theory (see Franklins book: Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability before Pascal).</p>

<h5 id="proof-beyond-reasonable-doubt-in-ancient-law">Proof beyond reasonable doubt in ancient law</h5>
<p>In ancient law a high standard of proof was required to convict any accused. In the <em>Talmud</em> and the <em>Roman Corpus of Civil Law</em> (which developed independently, but share huge similarities) proof needed to be beyond reasonable doubt. Example from the Talmud:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Witnesses in capital charges were brought in and warned: perhaps what you say is based only on conjecture, or hearasy, or is evidence form the mouth of another witness […] but in capital cases one is held responsible for his blood and the blood of his descendants till the end of the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On conjecture:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Perhaps you saw him running after his fellow into a ruin, you pursuid him, and found him sword in hand with blood dripping from it, whilst the murdered man was writhing. If this is what you saw, you saw nothing.</p>
</blockquote>
